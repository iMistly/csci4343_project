## Option 1 (local):

1) Make sure you have **Python** installed. Installation files can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2) Open your terminal/powershell and install the required packages via `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`
    - Ensure that the terminal has the project folder open
3) Run the code via `python ./main.py`
    - Depending on how you downloaded **Python** you may have to try the following variations:
        - `python3 ./main.py`
        - `py ./main.py`

## Option 2 (cloud):
